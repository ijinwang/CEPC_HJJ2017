\subsection{Inclusive higgs measurement}
\label{sec:inclusive_higgs_measurement}
Once the lepton pair was selected, we can extract the inclusive higgs decay number. 
This procedure is similar to what is done in \cite{CEPC:recoilmass}. 
After applying the cuts on azimuth angle and invariant mass of lepton pair system, the $ZH$ events number are worked out with a fit on the muon recoil system's mass. 
In the fit, the recoil masses shape of $ZH$ events and other SM processes are described by a crystal ball function and a second order Chebychev polynomial function respectively. 
The fit range was set as $110\GeV<M_{recoil}<140$\GeV.  \par
