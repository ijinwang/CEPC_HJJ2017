\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:summary}
The $ZH\to \mupair + \bpair/\cpair/\gpair$ brach ratio measurement is done with 5000 \ifb $\elpair$ collsion at $\sqrt{s} = $ 250 \GeV in CEPC experiment, demonstrating the capability of the CEPC experiment in Higgs yukawa coupling with its excellent PFA and flavor tagging performance. 
The statistic uncertainty for $H\to \bpair$, $H\to\cpair$ and $H\to\gpair$ branch fraction is esitmated as 1.1\%, 10.5\% and 5.4\%, while the systematic uncertainty of the 3 channels are $^{+0.73\%}_{-0.36\%}$, $^{+6.1\%}_{-6.2\%}$ and $^{7.6\%}_{-7.7\%}$. This is the first time to study $ZH\to \mupair + \bpair/\cpair/\gpair$ with fully 
simulation sample as well as taking into account the systematic unceraties. The results are consistent with the corresponding results in CEPC-SppC pre-CDR\cite{CEPC_preCDR} in terms of the statistic uncertainties. The results in this document will be incorporated with 
the study of $H\to/\bpair/\cpair/\gpair$ from other channels, like $qqH$ and $\nu\nu H$.\par
%The combination template fit from \eeh,\mmh,\nnh and \qqh $ $evaluate the uncertainty of $H\rightarrow \bpair$, $H\rightarrow \cpair$ and $H\rightarrow \gpair$ to be 0.27\%, 3.2\% and 1.6\%, reflecting the statistic uncertainty with 5000 \ifb integral luminosity data taken at $\sqrt{s} = $250 \GeV at CEPC. These results are done with all the backgrounds and signals from full simulation, and is consistent to the number estimated in pre-CDR. The precision of $H\rightarrow \bpair$ is mainly constrained by \qqh $ $channel, while the other two hadronic decay modes are mainly constrained by \nnh$ $ channel. In \qqh$ $ channel, $H\rightarrow \gpair/\cpair$ suffered from huge backgrounds from hadronic diboson process, and the mis-combination of jet pair degenerate the percision. To solve these problem, it is necessary to optimize the detector and reconstruction performance, which future work should concentrate on.
